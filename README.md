# Overheat-Detection

Project for School that allowed you to put an Arduino Uno near a PC, or other electronics, that are stored in a tight area.
Meant to alert a user if hardware is overheating.

NOTE: ALL values used were set so I could test the system, to actually use the device properly the user would need to specify a temperature that's harmful for the hardware components.
